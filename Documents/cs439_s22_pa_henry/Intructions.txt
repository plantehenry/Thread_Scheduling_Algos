The FinalProjectNew folder contains all of the different thread 
scheudling algorithm implementations. 
The cs439_s22_p3_henry, priorityQueue, RandomChoice, and RandomPriority folders
cs439_s22_p3_henry just implements round robin
can all run the test that shows off how the priority queue is good.
The test is called PT2. Just go into the folder and run make -s PT2.test;
The cs439_s22_p5_henry, Random Choice, RandomPriority, ShortestJobFirst, and LongestJobFirst
cs439_s22_p5_henry implements a round robin queue
can all run the test looking at minimizing turnournd time
the test is called ShortestTestNew. Just go into the folder and run make -s ShortestTestNew.test;
If you want to run the ShortestTestNew test multiple times and save the turnaround time values
that it outputs 
make -s ShortestTestNew.test && cat t0.out >> results && ... (over and over again as many times as you like)
all of the values (average turnaorund times) printing during the executon of multiple 
make -s ShortestTestNew.test will be stored in results for your viewing pleasure
