Your team name: henry (group 15)

What do you plan on doing?: Thread Scheduling algorithms

How do you plan on doing it?: I plan on implemting Shortest Job First, Longest Job First
, two random algorithms, and a priority queue. I will have to change the threads.cc and threads.h
implementations. In addition for some of the algotrithms I will implement a ready heap as opposed to a 
readyQ to get with insertion and retrival of threads efficiency. For some of the algorithms I also will have
to chnage the implemetatons of the syncronization primitives.

What research did you do?: I researched what other thread Scheduling algorithms
exists and how to analyze how good they are and what situtations they are good for

What alternatives did you consider?: Improving the file system - getting writeing working

What did you decide to do?: Thread Scheduling algorithms

What did you you learn so far?: I learned how there are many ways to measure
how good a Scheduling algorith is. You can look at average wait time, averge turnaround time
, how fair it is, if it is prone to starvation. And situations where one might be better than 
another.

I also leanred a bit about random number generation.

I also learned a bit about shell instructions and how to make output form a command go into a file
and how to tell the shell to do multiple commands in succesion.
